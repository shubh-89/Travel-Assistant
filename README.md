Kore. ai's XO Platform enables you to launch enterprise-grade, AI-enabled conversational Virtual Assistants using Bot Builder; an intuitive graphical interface for building, training, testing, and monitoring virtual assistants.
Using this Virtual Assistant user can book flight, cab. He can fetch booking details also he can modify booking details. Based upon user's choice backend database gets updated. The bot is smart enough to detect the language change. I have configured this bot for German language. So it can detect the change as you talk to it in different language.
